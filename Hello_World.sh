# Before you run this scrip under Linux prompt, make sure you'd changed the script's file permissions to allow it to be execute.
# For example, "chmod +X Hello_World.sh"
# Execute the file under Linux prompt, "./Hello_World.sh"

#!/bin/bash 		#=> this is a shebang line,. The interpreter of BASH is located at /bin/bash
echo "\"Hello World!\""

# To print the quotation mark, " from the line of Hello_World. ", add an escape character, 
# which is the backslash (\). So this special character will tell the interpreter to 
# ignore the special properties of the next character and just treat it as part of a given string.
